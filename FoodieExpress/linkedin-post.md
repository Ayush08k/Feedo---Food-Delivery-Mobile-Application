🚀 **Building FoodieExpress: Enhancing the Driver Experience**

Excited to share my recent work on **FoodieExpress**, a comprehensive food delivery application built with **React Native** and **TypeScript**!

Currently focused on the **Driver Section**, where I've been implementing features to improve the delivery workflow and driver experience:

**📊 Advanced Earnings Analytics**
- Interactive earnings report with visual data breakdown
- Multi-period filtering (daily, monthly, yearly, lifetime)
- Real-time earnings vs tips visualization with progress bars
- Performance metrics dashboard tracking deliveries, ratings, and on-time performance

**🚗 Driver Profile & Management**
- Vehicle registration system with multi-vehicle support
- Document verification portal with status tracking and expiry notifications
- Bank account integration for seamless earnings withdrawal
- Comprehensive profile management

**📦 Order & Delivery System**
- Real-time available orders feed with distance estimates
- Order acceptance/rejection workflow
- Complete delivery history with customer ratings and earnings breakdown
- Status tracking from pickup to completion

**💡 Technical Highlights:**
- Implementing clean, maintainable code with TypeScript
- Creating responsive, dark-themed UIs with NativeWind (Tailwind CSS)
- Building reusable components for scalable architecture
- Focus on user experience and intuitive navigation

The app follows the **Midnight Gourmet** design system with glassmorphism effects, smooth animations, and a premium dark theme aesthetic.
