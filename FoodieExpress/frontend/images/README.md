# Background Image Setup

## Required Image

Place your background image file in this directory with the exact name:
**`bg image.jpg`**

## Image Recommendations

For best results, use an image with the following specifications:
- **Format**: JPG or JPEG
- **Resolution**: At least 1080x1920 (portrait orientation)
- **Content**: Food-related imagery works best
- **Brightness**: Medium to dark images work better (due to the 70% black overlay)

## Already Implemented

The background image has been added to:
- ✅ RoleSelectionScreen (Category selection page)
- ✅ AuthScreen (Login/Signup page)

Both screens include a 70% black overlay (`bg-black/70`) to ensure text remains readable over the background.

## Testing

Once you add the image file, restart the app to see the background on the authentication screens.
